# FruitValidityDetector

If we have a production line for filtering and packaging fruits for later exportation meeting global standards, it would be hard to manually filter and seperate invalid fruits from valid ones and would cost time and money also, that's what inspired me for this project idea where I applied what I learned at college about computer vision methodologies and what AI and neural networks bring to the table facilitating our day to day to day life.

## This repo is mainly composed of three directories:-
  - **(App)** directory which contains the simulation source code that we might later implement using suitable hardware and mechanics to pick and filter fruits in a more precise and convenient manner.

  * ***(source)*** directory containing the prediction model saved as an h5 file.

  + ***(test-images)*** directory contains test images for the app along with a **simulation** directory containing test images for launching the app to simulate consecutive incomming of fruits on the line.

### Note: this project source code has been developed by me as my practical exam project for a computer vision class I had at college and not yet for commercial utilities.
